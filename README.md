# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is starting a fundraiser to fund their theater project, "Fever", and they have a budget of around $10,000 dollars for the production. Louise has asked for our help with help her find underlying trends with a variety of kickstarters that have succeeded, failed, or have been cancelled in order for her campaign to be successful. 

### Purpose

To find underlying trends among the kickstarters by utilizing Excel's graphical and analytical functions to analyze outcomes and trends based on a variaty of factors such as launch date, the kickstarter's goals and pledges, subcatagories and parent catagories, and location. Goal is to fine the most optimal way for Louise's kickstarter to successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When the kickstarters were filtered to only show theater production Kickstarters, the data showed that a more than  1/4 of the kickstarters for these productions that were successful were launched between the months of May and June and this has been cosistant through all the years these kickstarters were implimented. Of the 1,369 theater drives between 2009 and 2017, 839 were successful with 211 of those successful drives launching in May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

According to the analysis, the data showed that the play productions that were most successful started with a goal that wasless than $5000 dollars. Conversly, there was a downward turn in success rates once goals exceeded $20,000. The play productions that tried to push toward those higher goals and were successful are outliers and should not be accounted as a reliable representation overall. Even with the success of the outliers, most of these five figure drives consited of failed kickstarters.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenges I experienced in this dataset were minor issues like incorrect formatting with the dates and currency in some of the columns. Most of my issues with this dataset during my analysis were from my end due to inexperience and some issues with compiling the data when filters were not cleared. This lead to pivot tables and data charts not having the correct values when I tried compiling the data.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. It is recommended for Louise to launch the kickstarter around the months of May and June since The data shows that this time frame throughout all the years analyzed yielded the highest success rate.
2. Compared to most other parent catagories, theater kickstarters have the highest success rates when compared to other catagories, so Louise should have better prospects for her kickstarter.
3. In the month of december, Successful kickstarters are almost the same number as failed kickstarters. Louise should avoid starting the kickstarter on this month.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise has significantly higher chance of success is she can kickstart her fundraiser for $5,000 or less. The analysis shows that while $10000 is what Louise's wants for her play, for the greatest chance of success, she should fundraise for $5,000 or less.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are many outliers in this set that make it hard to get a more realistic median and skew the data. It could also be more detailed by having specific states and territories to help Louise pin-point a more accuarte location to start her play and/or fundraise.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could've done an even deeper analysis to see the average donations per month to see how long the drives should go to maximize donations, or to better pinpoint when the drives made the most money. This would provide us with even more information to maximize donations.
