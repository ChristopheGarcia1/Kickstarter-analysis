# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louis is starting a fundraiser to fund their theater project, "Fever", and they have a budget of around $10,000 dollars for the production. Louis has illicited our help in finding underlying trends in a variaty of kickstarters that have succeeded, failed, or have been cancelled in order for their campaign to be successful. 

### Purpose

To find underlying trends among the kickstarters by utilizing Excel's graphical and analytical functions to analyze outcomes trends based on a variaty of factors such as launch date, the kickstarter's goals and pledges, subcatagories and parent catagories, and location. Goal is to fine the most optimal way for Louis's kickstarter to successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When the kickstarters were filtered to only show theater production Kickstarters, the data showed that a more than a 1/4 of the of the kickstarters for these productions that were successful were launched between the months of May and June and this has been cosistant through all the years these kickstarters were implimented. Of the 1369 theater drives between 2009 and 2017, 839 were successful with 211 of those successful drives launching in May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

According to the analysis, the data showed that the play productions that were most successful started at less than $5000 dollars and there was a downward turn in success rates once goals exceeded $20000. The play productions that tried to push toward those higher goals and were successful are outliers and should not be accounted as reliable. However in most of these five figure drives, the failed kickstarters outnumber the successful ones. The analysis shows that while $10000 Louis's wants for her play, she has significantly higher chance of success is she can kickstart her fundraiser for $5000 or less.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenges I experienced in this dataset were little issues like incorrect formatting with the dates and currency in some of the columns. Most of my issues with this data set during my analysis were from my end due to inexperience and some issues with compiling the data when filters were not cleared out. This lead to pivot tables and data charts not having the correct values when I tried compiling the data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* * It is recommended to launch the kickstarter around this time period.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
